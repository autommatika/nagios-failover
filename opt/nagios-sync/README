# /opt/nagios-sync is required by all nagios users  - this is a local folder that is synchronised using unison protocol 

# /opt/nagios-sync/status.log - This is the status file used by  nagios-failover.sh to log an entry when nagios host a  takes over nagios host b
# It it used to calculate if configuration needs to be set back when nagios host b is back up and running


# /opt/nagios-sync/config_backup - this folder is where the actual /etc/nagios/nagios.cfg is backed up to pre any config additions to existing file
# When a failed nagios host is back up, the backed up config is returned to the relevant host that took on the task of doing additional monitoring.

# The status.log when updated by script will contain 3 items:
# prod nagios_server1 31713
# Environment Hostname random_id
# 1. Environment which in future will be actual data centre 
# 2. Hostname currently taken over that environment 
# 3. Random id which is the id added to the nagios.cfg backed up file
# With these logical values it can safely return the correct config file and ensure that only one of the many nagios servers is the only host to take over 


# There is also a master file in --> /etc/nagios/nagios.cfg.master
# The script will use this file if it can not map /opt/nagios-sync/config_backup/nagios.cfg.RANDOM_ID
# Please ensure you keep /etc/nagios/nagios.cfg.master the same as /etc/nagios/nagios.cfg on a regular basis
